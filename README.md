Art gallery promopages and flatfile based CMS

- Promopages and CMS system created in 2005
- Admin and public sites, see e.g. funktiot.php/funktiot_mod.php
- Although the CMS was not a real WYSIWYG, you could see the modifications in the admin site too
- CMS designed for older novice internet users
- A .txt based flatfile system was used as a database, see e.g. funktiot.php
- Session based authentication, see moderointi.php and e.g. index_mod.php
- IE6 compatibility

- Techniques used in this project:
1. XHTML, transitional (structure, markup)
2. CSS2-3 (nothing special, few IE6 fixes)
